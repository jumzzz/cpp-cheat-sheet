WARNING: The summary written are my personal simplifications of what I've read with Scott Myers Effective STL book. 
         I advice you should read the book itself to avoid misrepresentation of his list of advices on
         how to utilize C++ STL effectively. Some of the simplifications I've written are likely to be erroneous.
         Reading critically is adviced.  - Jums

Some Tips: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45hh81/experience_aaa_game_development_c/
1. Choose your containers with care
   - Every containers have different structures on their own. 
     Meaning they're designed in a particular set of applications.
     Though they usually have common interfaces that was set by
     the Standard Commitee of C++, there are specific containers
     that are easier to use on problem specific scenarios.

     i.e. vectors have constant time in accessing specific index
          whereas lists have O(n) time complexity in accessing
          values.

     TL:DR = It depends on their inherent data structure, it's 
             time/space complexity for each operations. And each
	     container types allocates/deallocates memory on 
             their own.


2. Beware of the illusion of container-independent code.
   - Experience will tell you that its difficult to code 
     without containers. This item is self explanatory.

3. Make copying cheap & correct for objects in containers.
   - Each container types have different approaches in allocating
     memory. Do not pay for something where you don't have to.
     This also emphasizes the need on grasping the basic mechanism
     of each container types.

4. Call empty instead of checking size() against zero.
   - empty() is O(1) and size() is O(n).

5. Prefer range member functions to their single-element
   counterparts
   a) Single-element operations (via loop) usually taxes operational
      costs (i.e. number of steps, memory allocation) than their
      range counterparts.
   b) Range member functions are obviously more readable.

6. Be alert for C++'s most vexing parse. 
   a) One example is when you instantiate an constructor let say

        Widget w();
    
       The compiler treats w as a function and not as an object
       variable.
   
   - This are usual subtleties of C++ and I think only experience
     will only let you understand them more.

7. When using containers of newed pointers, remember to delete
   them all.

  - Number(new) = Number(delete)
  - Apply iterative deletes on containers that has unique pointers
  - Use Smart Pointers for container of pointers if you're not
    sure if you'll deallocate them all.

8. Never create containers of auto_ptrs
  - Well, auto_ptr is a failure. Use Smart Pointers from either
    Boost or Modern C++ instead.

9. Choose carefully among erasing options
  - Each erasing options have different ways of erasing elements
    inside their containers. Be aware of their ways of erasing
    for convenience. #5 can be also applicable on this one.

10. Be aware of allocator conventions & restrictions
   - I barely understand this. Though I'm now aware with the fact
     that std::allocator are abstractions of memory allocation/deallocation
     schemes.

11. Understand legitimate uses of custom allocators
   - No comment. I'll read it soon.

12. Have realistic expectations about thread safety of STL containers
    a) Multiple threads reading on a same container are thread safe.
    b) Multiple threads writing on different containers simulteneously
       are thread safe.

13. Prefer vector & string to dynamically allocated arrays.
    - vector & strings offer beyond the functionality that dynamically
      allocated arrays offer. They offer much cleaner interfaces and 
      features (i.e. Iterators, range based functions) which you won't
      find on dynamically allocated arrays. They're also easily convertible
      to dynamically allocated arrays (i.e. int[] or const char*)

14. Use reserve to avoid unnecessary reallocations
    - Continuously appending vectors (i.e. single element insertion, push_back)
      will continuously update its capacity without using reserve(size_t n).
      This automated update of capacity yields to redundant copying, allocation/deallocation 
      which can be detrimental with its performance.

      Remember the Philosphy: Don't waste Time and Space -- This is C++

15. Be aware of variations in string implementations
    - From wstring, string, const char*, basic_string or frameworks 
      like boost::String , QString and CV::String.. It's pretty
      obvious many people like to have their own strings.

16. Know how to pass vector & string data to legacy C APIs
    - Need to ask more?
     
      // Vector implementation
      std::vector<T> v;    
      T* vptr = &v[0];
   
      // String implementation
      std::string str;
      const char* cstr = str.c_str();
     
17. Use "swap trick" to trim excess capacity
    - Good thing Modern C++ has this shrink_to_fit() member functions
      that saves me the trouble of swapping capacity to itself.


18. Avoid using std::vector<bool>
   - You are fake bools! - Donald Trump
   - Use the likes of std::deque<bool> instead.    

19. Understand difference between equality & equivalence
   (WARNING: THIS CAN BE MISLEADING)
   - The C++ committee doesn't make actual distinction between the two.
   - equality is a == b where as
   - equivalence is !(a < b) && !(b < a)
   - algorithms that requires sorting i.e. binary_search, adjacent_find, and 
     member functions of associative containers such as find, find_if uses
     equivalence instead of equality
   - equivalence are far more "suited" in ordered containers or associative
     containers than equality most of the time?

20. Specify comparison types for associative containers of pointers
   (WARNING: THIS CAN BE MISLEADING)
   - associative containers like set are defined as set<T,Predicate = SomeDefaultPredicate>
   - Those default predicates doesn't necessarily works when T is defined as pointers.
    Hence, it's an imperative for the STL programmer to define comparison type manually
    for their associative container/s of pointers.

21. Always have comparison functions return false for equal values
   
   (WARNING: Explanation might be misleading)
   - Since it was stated that Associative containers follows equivalence on its comparison
     functions, we have to be sure that it must be followed that's why returning equals as 
     false is necessary.

22. Avoid in-place key modification in set & multi-set.

   - By default, set & multi-set are automatically sorted -- modifying in-place key can
     corrupt set & multi-set since you're changing its value which is already sorted.

23. Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectors.

   - There are STL algorithms that actually works well with sorted vectors compared
     to associative containers like set. It's a matter of taste and design preference.

     Therefore: If it can make things simpler consider it.

24. Choose carefully between map::operator[] & map-insert when efficiency is important.

   - On inserting new <Key,Values> on maps map::insert is much more efficient.
   - On modifying existing <Key,Values> using operator [] is much more efficient. 

25. Familiarize yourself with nonstandard hashed containers.

  - Hash containers are really worth it since many of its average operations are done in 
    constant time O(1) and its worst complexity are usually O(n).
  - Hash containers have its implementation in Boost, if your compiler is C++98 or lower
  - unordered_map<T> is the current hashed container for Modern C++ (11 and up).

26. Prefer iterator to const_interator, reverse_iterator & const_reverse_iterator

  - It's easier to convert iterator to const_iterator, reverse_iterator & const_reverse_iterator.
    The other way around is much more difficult.

  - Most of the STL algorithms accepts iterator as its range arguments.

27.  Use distance & advance to convert container's const_iterators to iterators
   
   - This is the proper way of doing it.
   - Don't use casting fool! These are different classes and not related via inheritance.

28. Understand how to use reverse_iterator's base iterator.

   - Its base iterator is an iterator. If you try to convert reverse_iterator to it's base 
     iterator, and apply it as range argument for your STL algorithm of choice, you will not
     observe the same behavior that reverse_iterator exhibits. I've tried it and experienced
     a buffer overflow error.

29. Consider istreambuf_iterators for character-by-character input
   
   - It's by far more effective compared to its istream_iterator counterpart.

30. Make sure destination ranges are big enough
  
   - Self explanatory. You want to apply an algorithm which in-scope with your problem specifications.

31. Know your sorting options.

   - There are sort, stable_sort, partial_sort, etc. which has their own advantage and disadvantages
     when it comes to performance. Know them well so you can apply them right depending on the specifications
     of the problem you're seeking to solve.

32.  Follow remove-like algorithms by erase if your really want to remove something.
  
   - "remove" is weird. It just returning an iterator where elements you want to removed are
      just "marked". If you want to remove it completely, you have to follow it with erase.
      This is true on contiguous type containers like vectors.

33.  Be wary of remove-like algorithms on containers of pointers.
  
   - When you add a pointer inside a containers, you're just adding its memory address. You don't
     allocate them inside of the container.
   - You don't necessarily deallocate those memory when you apply remove and erase. 
   - Make sure you apply deletion on raw pointers inside your container "BEFORE" deleting 
     them.

34. Note which algorithms expect sorted ranges
   
  - Some STL algorithms that guarantees O(nlog(n)) -- but you have to sort them first so these 
    STL algorithms behave properly like binary_search, adjacent_find, etc.
  - There are also STL algorithms that will still behave right if they're not sorted BUT will be 
    more effective if you sort the container that you'll apply (i.e. unique).

35. Implement simple case-insensitive string comparisons via mismatch or lexicographical compare
   - Again, these is where equivalance comes again.
   - lexicographical compare are just used for strings (WARNING: might be misleading)

36. Understand the proper implementation of copy_if.
   - copy_if is just copy with steroids. Nah jst kidding.
   - it generates a list of copy under specific conditions (WARNING: might be misleading)

37. Use accumulate or for_each to summarize ranges.
   - Well, accumulate is pretty much useful if you apply a cascading operations on ranges.
   - for_each is pampapogi, meaning you can do some one liner loop operations without writing
     an actual loop. Well, it's a range based loop and range based counter-parts are usually
     cleaner and more effective than it's single element based loops. Check Item #5.

38. Design functor classes for pass-by-value
   (WARNING: Explanation might be misleading)
   - So you won't have to modify it inside of a Functor class.

39. Make predicate pure functions
   (WARNING: THIS WILL BE A QUESTION)
   - What the fuck is a pure function??

40. Make functor classes adaptable
   (WARNING: THIS WILL BE A QUESTION)
   - How to make them fucking adaptable??

41. Understand the reasons for ptr_fun, mem_fun, and mem_fun_ref
   (WARNING: THIS CAN BE MISLEADING)
   - These are abstractions in order to convert functions like function pointers as predicates.

42. Make sure less<T> means operator<
   (WARNING: THIS CAN BE MISLEADING)
   - The fuck, you can confuse template declarations to less or greater than! 

43. Prefer algorithm calls to hand-written loops.
   - To avoid re-inventing the wheel.
   - It's much more readable.
   - More likely to be faster.
   - Follows Item #5.

44. Prefer member functions to algorithms with the same names
   - member functions usually inlined compared functions that are located in scope.

45.
