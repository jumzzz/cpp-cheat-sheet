1. Choose your containers with care
   - Every containers have different structures on their own. 
     Meaning they're designed in a particular set of applications.
     Though they usually have common interfaces that was set by
     the Standard Commitee of C++, there are specific containers
     that are easier to use on problem specific scenarios.

     i.e. vectors have constant time in accessing specific index
          whereas lists have O(n) time complexity in accessing
          values.

     TL:DR = It depends on their inherent data structure, it's 
             time/space complexity for each operations. And each
	     container types allocates/deallocates memory on 
             their own.


2. Beware of the illusion of container-independent code.
   - Experience will tell you that its difficult to code 
     without containers. This item is self explanatory.

3. Make copying cheap & correct for objects in containers.
   - Each container types have different approaches in allocating
     memory. Do not pay for something where you don't have to.
     This also emphasizes the need on grasping the basic mechanism
     of each container types.

4. Call empty instead of checking size() against zero.
   - empty() is O(1) and size() is O(n).

5. Prefer range member functions to their single-element
   counterparts
   a) Single-element operations (via loop) usually taxes operational
      costs (i.e. number of steps, memory allocation) than their
      range counterparts.
   b) Range member functions are obviously more readable.

6. Be alert for C++'s most vexing parse. 
   a) One example is when you instantiate an constructor let say

        Widget w();
    
       The compiler treats w as a function and not as an object
       variable.
   
   - This are usual subtleties of C++ and I think only experience
     will only let you understand them more.

7. When using containers of newed pointers, remember to delete
   them all.

  - Number(new) = Number(delete)
  - Apply iterative deletes on containers that has unique pointers
  - Use Smart Pointers for container of pointers if you're not
    sure if you'll deallocate them all.

8. Never create containers of auto_ptrs
  - Well, auto_ptr is a failure. Use Smart Pointers from either
    Boost or Modern C++ instead.

9. Choose carefully among erasing options
  - Each erasing options have different ways of erasing elements
    inside their containers. Be aware of their ways of erasing
    for convenience. #5 can be also applicable on this one.

10. Be aware of allocator conventions & restrictions
   - I barely understand this. Though I'm now aware with the fact
     that std::allocator are abstractions of memory allocation/deallocation
     schemes.

11. Understand legitimate uses of custom allocators
   - No comment. I'll read it soon.

12. Have realistic expectations about thread safety of STL containers
    a) Multiple threads reading on a same container are thread safe.
    b) Multiple threads writing on different containers simulteneously
       are thread safe.

13. Prefer vector & string to dynamically allocated arrays.
    - vector & strings offer beyond the functionality that dynamically
      allocated arrays offer. They offer much cleaner interfaces and 
      features (i.e. Iterators, range based functions) which you won't
      find on dynamically allocated arrays. They're also easily convertible
      to dynamically allocated arrays (i.e. int[] or const char*)

14. Use reserve to avoid unnecessary reallocations
    - Continuously appending vectors (i.e. single element insertion, push_back)
      will continuously update its capacity without using reserve(size_t n).
      This automated update of capacity yields to redundant copying, allocation/      deallocation which can be detrimental with its performance.

      Remember the Philosphy: Don't waste Time and Space -- This is C++

15. Be aware of variations in string implementations
    - From wstring, string, const char*, basic_string or frameworks 
      like boost::String , QString and CV::String.. It's pretty
      obvious many people like to have their own strings.

16. Know how to pass vector & string data to legacy C APIs
    - Need to ask more?
     
      // Vector implementation
      std::vector<T> v;    
      T* vptr = &v[0];
   
      // String implementation
      std::string str;
      const char* cstr = str.c_str();
     
17. Use "swap trick" to trim excess capacity
    - Good thing Modern C++ has this shrink_to_fit() member functions
      that saves me the trouble of swapping capacity to itself.


18. Avoid using std::vector<bool>
   - You are fake bools! - Donald Trump
   - Use the likes of std::deque<bool> instead.
